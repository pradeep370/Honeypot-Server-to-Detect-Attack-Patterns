# <div align="center"> Honeypot Server to Detect Attack Patterns </div>

---

## ⭐ Introduction

Cybersecurity threats are increasing day by day, with attackers frequently targeting servers and networks using brute-force techniques. To analyse and defend against such threats, security researchers use honeypots, which act as decoy systems to attract attackers and study their activities. A honeypot records malicious attempts without putting real systems at risk. Among them, Cowrie SSH Honeypot is a widely used medium-interaction honeypot that simulates SSH services. It captures login attempts, executed commands, and attacker behaviour in detail, providing valuable insights. This data helps in identifying attack patterns, techniques, and malicious intentions. Through this project, Cowrie demonstrates how honeypots can enhance cybersecurity by offering real-time threat intelligence and strengthening defence strategies.

## ✅ Conclusion

The Cowrie SSH Honeypot project successfully demonstrated how attackers attempt brute-force logins and execute malicious commands. By integrating GeoIP2, the project tracked attacker locations and provided valuable insights into global attack sources. The addition of email alerts ensured real-time monitoring of malicious activities. Overall, this project highlights the importance of honeypots in understanding attacker behaviour and strengthening cybersecurity defence strategies.
